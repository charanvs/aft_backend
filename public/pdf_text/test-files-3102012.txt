JUDGMENT

Date: 29-03-2011

1. The O.A. was filed by the applicant on 10-08-2010. Vide this
O.A., the applicant has prayed for setting aside Army Headquarters
letter dated 11-05-2009. He also seeks re-examination of all records
including the DPC board proceedings and impugned ACR of 2002 in
the light of Army Order (AO) 1/2002/MP thereby seeking promotion to
the rank of Naib Subedar (Nb Sub) at par with his batch mates with
consequential financial benefits. A prayer is also made for direction
that all financial benefits accrued as Battle Casualty (BC) under the

relevant scheme be paid.

2. The brief facts of the case are that applicant was enrolled in the
army on 05-02-1988. He became a BC in Jammu and Kashmir on 06-
07-2002 where he received a Gun Shot Wound (GSW) on his left
thigh. Despite his handicap, he passed the Promotion Cadre from Hav
to Nb Sub which was conducted from 16-09-2003 to 30-11-2003.
However he received lukewarm reports for the ACR since he was a

BC. This led to his supersession.

3. The applicant states that he was not given a fair chance in his
ACR for 2002 as he was neither counselled nor warned regarding his
performance, in case it was adverse. He also states that though a BC,
he has passed his mandatory promotion test in time. The applicant
neither has any red ink entry nor he has been any warning or
counselling by the Commanding Officer (CO), therefore, there are
legitimate expectations for obtaining a good ACR commensurate with

his dedicated services.

4. On being superseded, the applicant preferred a statutory
complaint on 09-05-2008. The complaint was disposed of vide Army

Headquarters letter dated 11-05-2009.

5. Learned counsel for the applicant stated that he has no
grievance regarding the applicant being declared BC except that he
has not been paid the dues that have been announced by the State
Governments as also by the Central Government. The applicant is in

receipt of pension as per BC.

6. Learned counsel for the applicant further argued that since the
applicant was a BC, he was provided with sheltered appointment. In
these appointments, he performed his duties to the best of his ability.
No counselling or warning was given by the CO or his immediate
superior. He, therefore, expects that his ACRs were positive and
recommendatory for promotion. However he alleged that he has been

wrongly superseded when the board was held in 2008.

7. Learned counsel for the respondents stated that the averment
made by the applicant qua BC is not contested. The applicant has
been declared a BC and the factor has been taken into consideration.
Since the applicant was a low medical category being a BC, he was
granted a sheltered appointment and was constantly graded high
average throughout with recommendation for promotion in his ACRs

by his superiors.

8. In reply it was submitted that vide Army Headquarters letter dated

10-10-1997, criteria for promotion to the rank of Nb Sub is as under :

“A(b)/(i) Only last five reports will be considered, out
of which minimum three reports must be in the rank of
Havildar and in case of shortfall rest may be in the rank of
Naik.

(ii) | At last three out of last five reports should be
Above Average with a minimum of two in the rank of
Havildar and remaining should be not less than High

Average.

(iii) | The applicant should have been recommended for

promotion in all the five reports.”
9. Learned counsel for the respondents pointed out in his written
averment vide his reply that applicant had received consistently a high
average grading in ACRs, except in 2008 where he was graded Above
Average by the Initiating Officer (IO) but High Average by the RO
(Reporting Officer). In all the ACRs, the applicant was recommended
for promotion. Therefore, it cannot be construed as an adverse report
and none of the ACR warranted any warning/counselling by the

superior officer.

10. Learned counsel for the respondents further argued that Ex-
Gratia payment available to the applicant from the Central Government
has been correctly assessed and paid for and a sum of Rs.10,000/-
was paid in accordance with the degree of disability that has been
determined by the medical board. The State Government of Jammu
and Kashmir from where the applicant belongs has already granted
Rs.10,000/- to the applicant on 24-08-1993 as Ex-Gratia benefit from
the State. Perusal of the disability certificate of the applicant indicates
that the disability of the applicant is partial and not permanent and,
therefore, he is not entitled for one time grant out of Army Central

Welfare Fund.

11. Having heard both the parties and having examined the
documents in original, we conclude that the applicant is a BC who
suffered from GSW consequent to which he became a low medical
category. He has received the compensation from the State

Government to which the applicant belongs.

12. As regards the promotion of the applicant, it is obvious that the
applicant did not meet all the criteria for being approved to the rank of
Nb Sub. He had passed his promotion cadre. He also cleared the
other mandatory tests in education and map reading, and was a BC.
Hence his medical category was of no consequence. This made him
eligible for consideration for promotion to the rank of Nb Sub. However
he lacked in the ACR criteria where he should have had at least three
Above Average reports and two High Average reports in the last five
years. In this case all reports of applicants were of High Average
except one ACR of 2002 of average but still he did not meet the ACR
criteria as laid down in the Army Headquarters letter dated 10.10.1997.

His ACR profiles as stated by the respondents are as under :

Sr.No | Year Points Awarded | Points Awarded | Recommended/Not
by Initiating | by © Reviewing | recommended for
Officer Officer promotion

(i) 2002 6 (High Average) | 4(Average) Recommended

(ii) 2003 6 (High Average) | 6 Recommended

(iii) 2004 6 (High Average) | 6 Recommended

(iv) 2005 6 (High Average) | 6 Recommended

(v) 2006 6 (High Average) | 5 Recommended
(vi) 2007 6 (High Average) | 5 Recommended
(vii) 2008 7 (High Average) | 5 Recommended
(viii) | 2009 5 (High Average) | 5 Recommended

13. In view of the foregoing, we opine that promotion of the applicant
to the rank of Nb Sub has correctly been considered by the
respondents and since he did not meet the ACR criteria, he was not
approved for promotion and thus he was superseded that is not

required any interference.

14. The applicant is also entitled to assistance from the Central
Government as he falls under Category 6 of Appendix F of
Government notification dated 03-02-2000. The extracts of Category 6

are listed as under :

“CATEGORY 6 (OPERATIONS) OTHER THAN OP VIJAY (KARGIL)
W.E.F. 1 MAY 1999

Benefits to Next of Kin of the Deceased

Officers, JCOs/OR

1. Ex-Gratia from Central Government. - Rs.7.5 lakh
2. National Defence Fund - Nil

3. Army Central Welfare Fund - Rs.30,000

3. Army Central Welfare Fund*
(a) Boarded Out - Rs.1 lakh
(b) Retained in Service
(Based on percentage disability) - Rs.30,000
Rs.20,000 or Rs.10,000

Note : ----- *Announced and implemented w.e.f October 1999”

15. As regards, the applicant being BC and a low medical category,
the applicant has been considered as “temporary medical category
with scope for improvement”, and hence has been granted Rs.10,000/-
from the Army Central Welfare Fund. However, considering the fact
the applicant has retired and is in receipt of disability allowance which
is governed by para 6 of the Govt of India letter of 07.02.2001, the
disability percentage is reckoned “for life”. Hence he is entitled for due
payment from the Central Government besides the disability pension
that is his due for being a BC. We consider it a fit case to be referred
back to the authorities to reconsider the case for grant of due payment
as discussed from the Army Central Welfare Fund under Category 6 of
Appendix F of Government notification issued on 03-02-2000. The
State of Jammu and Kashmir is not party before us, therefore, if any
grievances remain against the State, the applicant is free to agitate the

same before the appropriate authority.
